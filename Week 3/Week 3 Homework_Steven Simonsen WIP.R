#Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments
#for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn
#based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between
#the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement
#in symptoms of sinusitis? 
One other explanation for the result of this study is that there are many types
of antibiotics used to treat varying health conditions. Amoxicillin is only one
of those choices, and another choice in antibiotic may yield varying results
in the study.

#1.20
#(a) What type of study is this?
Observational
#(b) Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.
Use multistage sampling to randomly sample stuends from each cluster being made
up of students from the eastern and wesetern dorms and their year. Say, pick 10
students from each year that live in the eastern or western dorms, totaling 40
students for the study.

#1.26
This could introduce bias into the equation for two reasons. The first being
that only one elementary school is sampled, and may face varying socioeconomic
factors impacting family size from other schools. The second is the overall age
of children in elementary schools. Children in elementary schools may have 
parents, and therefore families, that are of a younger age than other households
who may have older children, or none at all. Therefore, the the true value will
most likely be understimated.

#1.30
#(a) Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?
Experiment, because treatment was applied to the participants
#(b) What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?
Explanatory: Placebo, 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C plus additives. 
Response: Measure of cold duration or severity
#(c) Were the patients blinded to their treatment?
Yes
#(d) Was this study double-blind?
This is tricky, but yes. Although the nurses knew which patients were getting
varying treatments, the researchers collecting the data did not.
#(e) Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills
#prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take 
#their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? 
#Explain your reasoning.
It does introduce a confounding variable in the study, which is the willingness
of the patient to take their pills. This affects both the explanatory and 
response variables, thus making it a confounding variable. 

#1.34
#(a) What type of study is this?
Experiment, as treatment is applied (exercise)
#(b) What are the treatment and control groups in this study?
Treament group: Half of the subjects instructed to exercise twice per week.
Control group: Half of the subjects instructed not to exercise.
#(c) Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?
No, the subjects are not grouped into blocks based on variables other than the
treatment, which in this case is exercise.
#(d) Does this study make use of blinding?
No, subjects are aware that they are in the control group because they are told
not to exercise. There is no placebo.
#(e) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish
#a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether 
#or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.
I cannot reasonably conclude that the results of the study can be used to
establish a causal relationship between exercise and health. Although the study
randomizes the sample fairly well, it does not control for variables such as 
how long each subject exercises, the intensity of the exercieses, 
and the type of exercise such as caridovascular and/or weight training. For the 
same reasons, I would not feel comfortable generalizing the results of the 
study to the population at large.
#(f) Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should
#get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?
I would have reservations about funding the study. Better controls and better
replication should be introduced into the study. A solution to improve in these
areas is to assign the same exercise intensity, type, and time to each subject.
The study could be repeated to ensure sound results, if funding is available to
do so. Blocking could be introduced to seperate by suspected confounding
variables as well.

c is bimodal and corresponds with 1.

#2.12
I would expect the median to be around 80, and the mean to be slightly less
around 70 or 75 due to the left skewed distribution of the data.

#2.16
#(a) Housing prices in a country where 25% of the houses cost below $350,000, 
#50% of the houses cost below $450,000, 75% of the houses cost below $1,000,000
#and there are a meaningful number of houses that cost more than $6,000,000.
I expect the data to be left skewed, as there are a meaningful number of houses
far above the the Q3 point of the data. The median would better represent the 
data as a robust statistic because it is less effective by extreme values in
the data, and I would consider a meaningful number of houses costing above 
$6,000,000 to be extreme. For the same reason, I would expect the IQR as a
better represenation of the variability as it is less impacted by extreme
values being a robust statistic.
#(b) Housing prices in a country where 25% of the houses cost below $300,000, 
#50% of the houses cost below $600,000, 75% of the houses cost below $900,000 
#and very few houses that cost more than $1,200,000.
I expect the data to by distributed symmretrically, as the data seems to be
relatively evenly distributed across Q1, the median, and Q3. Additionally, there
are few houses costing more than $1,200,000. The mean would better represent the
data as a non-robust statistic as there are few extreme values in the dataset.
For this same reason, I would expect the standard deviation to be a better
measure of the data as a non-robust statistic. 
#(c) Number of alcoholic drinks consumed by college students in a given week. 
#Assume that most of these students don't drink since they are under 21 years 
#old, and only a few drink excessively.
I expect the data to be right skewed since most students do not drink, and only
a few drink excessively. The median would better represent the data as a
robust statistic since the data is somewhat extreme considering the majority of
the values are populated at 0. For the same reason I would expect the IQR to be
a better representation of variability because it is less impacted by many 
values populated at 0.
#(d) Annual salaries of the employees at a Fortune 500 company where only a few
#high level executives earn much higher salaries than all the other employees.
Again, assuming number of employees is on the x-axis of a histogram, and the 
salary is on the y-axis, I would expect this data to be right skewed. Since
a few of the employees make a much higher salary, the mean may give an
incorrect outlook of the data because it would be inflated by the outliers.
Therefore, the median would be a better indicator of the dataset. Additionally,
The IQR would better measure the variability for the same reason, the standard
deviation would be much more heavily impacted by the outliers in the dataset.

#(a) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives?
percent(372/910)
#(b) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters are in favor of the citizenship 
#option?
percent(278/910)
#(c) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives
#and are in favor of the citizenship option?
percent(57/910)
#(d) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters who identify themselves as 
#conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of 
#moderates share this view? What percent of liberals share this view?
percent(57/372) #conservative
percent(120/363) #moderate
percent(101/175) #liberal
#(e) Do political ideology and views on immigration appear to be independent? 
#Explain your reasoning.
percent(179/372) #conservatives that feel workers should leave
percent(101/175) #liberals that feel workers should apply for citizenship

Based on the sample collected, there appears to be an association between 
political ideology and views on immigration. Based on the total number Tampa 
voters that identify as conservative, 48% of them feel workers should leave
the country and lose their jobs. Conversely, 58% of Tampa voters that identify
as liberal feel that workers should apply for citizenship. None of the groups
(liberal, moderate, or conservative) felt most strongly that workers should
apply for the guest work and citizenship. However, it must be noted that there
is more than likely bias introduced in this survey. Most responders 
identified themselves as conservative (41%). This may be indicative that 
Tampa FL voters may identify overall as more conservative. It may be worth
sampling population from other areas of the US, or using stratified sampling to
achieve a more consistent result.

#2.24
Based on the mosaic plot I would say views on taxes and political affiliation
appear to be independent. Across all parties, the highest response rate was
slanted towards raising taxes on the rish, and the minimum was slanted towards
raising taxes on the poor. The only difference being that the Republican and 
Indep/Other parties had a much higher population of voters that were unsure.
